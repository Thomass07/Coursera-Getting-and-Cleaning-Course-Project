# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Course-Project


This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

Unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and rename the folder with "data".

Copy the run_analysis.R script in the data folder.

Use source("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio. 

The name of the result file is Final_result.txt. (independent tidy data set)
