# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Course-Project


This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

Unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
Use source("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio. 

***Please note I haven't finished the course project completely, because I did not allocate enough time
for doing the last step, so this script haven't solved the 5th Step***
